Interview Introduction Template

First, I'd like to thank you for inviting me to this interview opportunity.

My name is Hanif Maliki, and I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Alterra Bills, a fintech company that processes bill payments and digital products.

I have over 4 years of experience in software development across multiple industries - fintech, healthcare logistics, mining, and enterprise solutions. Throughout my career, I've consistently delivered solutions that improve business efficiency and drive real impact.

In my current role at Alterra, I work on systems that handle over 1 million transactions daily. I've led several key initiatives including:
- Designing a "Rule Engine" system that automatically selects the best payment partners, improving both reliability and profitability
- Implementing microservices architecture that made our systems more scalable and easier to maintain
- Optimizing database performance, which significantly reduced response times

My technical expertise covers the full development cycle - from backend systems using Golang and Node.js, to user-friendly frontend applications with React, and deployment using modern cloud technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

What sets me apart is my ability to translate complex technical challenges into business solutions. For example, I previously developed an AI-powered platform for a global business expansion company, and I've led digital transformation projects in the mining industry that improved operational efficiency.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from Universitas Gadjah Mada, where I graduated with a 3.46 GPA and served as student organization president. I also won 1st place in a national robotics competition.

I'm passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to learn and grow.

Thank you for your time, and I'm excited to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team's success.
