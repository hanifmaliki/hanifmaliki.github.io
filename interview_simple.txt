Simple Interview Introduction

Thank you for inviting me to this interview.

My name is Hanif Maliki, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Alterra Bills, a fintech company.

I have 4 years of experience building software solutions across different industries - fintech, logistics, mining, and enterprise companies. I work with both backend and frontend technologies, and I'm comfortable with the full development process.

At my current company, I work on systems that process over 1 million transactions daily. I've led projects to improve system performance and built new features that help the business run more efficiently.

My main skills include backend development with Golang and Node.js, frontend with React, and modern deployment tools like Docker and Kubernetes.

I enjoy solving complex problems and working with teams to build software that makes a real difference for businesses and users.

I'm excited about this opportunity and look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
